📌 Overview

This project analyzes IT support tickets to understand key performance trends such as resolution time, priority handling, SLA adherence, and workload distribution.
It also includes a machine learning model that predicts ticket resolution categories based on ticket features.

The project is structured using SQL for data extraction, Excel for cleaning, and Python for exploratory analysis & prediction.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
SQL: Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions, Subqueries
Excel: Cleaning, Formatting, Data Preparation
PowerBI:For Dashboard
Machine Learning: Classification Model (Random Forest / Logistic Regression)
Jupyter Notebook: Analysis & Model Building

📌 Key Project Steps
1️⃣ Data Cleaning (Excel & Python)
Removed duplicates and missing values
Standardized ticket categories and priority levels
Converted inconsistent date formats
Extracted SLA variables

2️⃣ SQL Analysis
Using multiple SQL scripts, the project covers:
Ticket volume by category and agent
Avg. resolution time
Priority-wise escalation trends
SLA breach identification
Support team performance metrics

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
Ticket distribution across departments
Resolution time variation
Impact of ticket priority on SLA outcomes
Agent performance and workload metrics

4️⃣ Machine Learning Prediction
Built a predictive model to classify ticket resolution outcomes.
Model steps included:
✔ Feature extraction
✔ Train-test split
✔ Model training
✔ Performance evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)

📈 Key Insights
High-priority tickets take 2.3× longer on average to resolve.
Majority of SLA breaches occur on weekends or after working hours.
Ticket volume is highest in Technical Support and System Issues categories.
Machine learning model achieved 80–85% accuracy in predicting resolution outcomes.

🧠 Future Improvements
Deploy prediction model as API using Flask
Build an interactive dashboard using Power BI / Streamlit
Add a real-time ticket monitoring system
