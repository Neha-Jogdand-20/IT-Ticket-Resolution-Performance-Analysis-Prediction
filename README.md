# IT-Ticket-Resolution-Performance-Analysis-Prediction
This project focuses on analyzing IT support tickets to uncover trends in ticket handling, resolution efficiency, and SLA performance. A machine learning model is also built to predict resolution outcomes based on historical data.  The project uses Excel for cleaning, SQL for analysis, and Python (Scikit-learn) for ML-based prediction.
